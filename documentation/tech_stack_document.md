# Tech Stack Document for Modular-MCP-for-OEM-Compatibles

This document explains, in plain language, the technologies chosen for the **Modular-MCP-for-OEM-Compatibles** project. It shows how each part works together to give you a fast, flexible, and reliable way to control hardware modules without needing deep technical background knowledge.

## 1. Frontend Technologies

Although this project does not include a traditional web or mobile interface, it does provide a user-facing Command-Line Interface (CLI). Here’s what we use and why:

- **Programming Language:**
  - **Python** (with **Click**) *or* **Node.js** (with **Commander.js**)
  - Chosen because they let us write clear, interactive commands quickly and handle user input safely.
- **Text Output & Styling:**
  - **Colorama** (Python) or **Chalk** (Node.js)
  - Adds simple colors and formatting to help users read status messages and errors at a glance.
- **Configuration Files:**
  - **YAML** or **JSON** formats
  - These human-readable files let you define which hardware modules to load and how to configure them without touching code.

How this benefits you:
- You interact with the MCP tool by typing familiar commands like `start`, `status`, or `fan set-speed 75`.
- Clear, color-coded messages guide you through setup, show progress, and highlight issues.

## 2. Backend Technologies

The core system—the brains that talks to your hardware—is built for speed, reliability, and flexibility:

- **Core Language:** **C++**
  - Offers low-level access needed to talk directly to hardware buses (I2C, SPI, UART) and guarantees high performance.
- **Build System:** **CMake**
  - Automatically finds and compiles all parts of the project on Linux, Windows, and embedded platforms.
- **Module System & Dependency Injection:**
  - A lightweight **DI (Dependency Injection)** setup (using **Boost.DI** or a custom solution) ensures each module gets just what it needs—no more, no less.
- **Event Bus:**
  - A simple in-process **publish/subscribe** mechanism lets modules announce events (like temperature changes) and listen for ones they care about (like fan-control requests), all without tight coupling.
- **Configuration Parsing:**
  - **nlohmann/json** or **yaml-cpp** libraries read your JSON/YAML files, validate them, and turn them into runtime instructions.
- **Logging:** **spdlog**
  - Produces timestamped, module-aware logs so you can trace exactly what happened if something goes wrong.
- **Testing:**
  - **Google Test** (for C++ modules)
  - **pytest** (if you choose Python scripts) or **Jest** (for Node.js)
  - Mocks simulate hardware so you can catch logic errors before touching real devices.

How this benefits you:
- The system starts in under 2 seconds on typical hardware and responds to commands in under 100 ms.
- Each hardware type lives in its own module—add a new sensor or actuator by dropping in a module and updating your config.

## 3. Infrastructure and Deployment

To keep development smooth and releases reliable, we use the following practices:

- **Version Control:** **Git** on **GitHub**
  - Tracks every change; lets you roll back or share code easily.
- **Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):** **GitHub Actions**
  - Automatically builds and tests on Linux, Windows, and ARM every time you push code.
  - Packages binaries with **CPack** (for C++) and publishes them as **GitHub Releases**.
- **Package Management:**
  - **pip** (for Python CLI) or **npm** (for Node.js CLI)
  - Makes installing the CLI tool as simple as `pip install mcpctl` or `npm install -g mcpctl`.
- **Artifact Storage:**
  - Binary and source packages stored in GitHub, so you always have a stable download for your target platform.

How this benefits you:
- Every change gets automatically checked—fewer surprises.
- Installing or updating the MCP tool is a one-step command.

## 4. Third-Party Integrations

We rely on a few key open-source components to avoid reinventing the wheel:

- **Click** or **Commander.js** for building the CLI menu and command handlers.
- **nlohmann/json**, **yaml-cpp**, or **PyYAML** for reading configuration files.
- **Boost.DI** for dependency injection in C++ modules.
- **spdlog** for fast, thread-safe logging.
- **Google Test**, **pytest**, or **Jest** for unit and integration tests.

How this benefits you:
- Proven, community-supported libraries mean more stability.
- Faster development—focus on your hardware logic instead of plumbing.

## 5. Security and Performance Considerations

Even though this is a local CLI tool, we’ve built in safeguards and optimizations:

Security:
- **Input Validation:** Every config file is schema-checked to prevent typos or malicious values.
- **Local-Only Access:** No network server by default, so there’s no exposed surface for attackers.
- **Error Handling:** Clear messages and nonzero exit codes let scripts detect failures.

Performance:
- **C++ Core:** Direct hardware access keeps command latency under 100 ms.
- **RAII & Static Analysis:** C++ resource management patterns (RAII) plus tools like **Clang-Tidy** catch leaks early.
- **Event Throttling:** The event bus can rate-limit bursts so logging or module updates don’t overwhelm the system.

How this benefits you:
- You get reliable, predictable behavior even on resource-constrained devices.
- Fast startup and response times mean you can integrate MCP into automated test rigs or monitoring loops.

## 6. Conclusion and Overall Tech Stack Summary

Our choices combine performance, flexibility, and ease of use:

- **Frontend:** A lightweight, colorized CLI built in Python or Node.js for instant access.
- **Backend:** A high-performance C++ core with modular HAL and functionality pieces, orchestrated by a custom event bus and DI system.
- **Deployment:** GitHub-backed CI/CD with cross-platform builds, packaged for one-step installation.
- **Integrations:** Well-known libraries for JSON/YAML parsing, logging, and testing, so you spend time on hardware logic—not plumbing.

Together, these technologies let you plug in new hardware modules, adjust behavior via simple config files, and interact through an intuitive command line—all without diving into low-level details. The result is a modern, reliable, and extensible control panel framework that adapts to any OEM hardware you choose to add.
