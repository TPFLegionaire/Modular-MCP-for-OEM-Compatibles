# Security Guidelines for Modular-MCP-for-OEM-Compatibles

This document defines the security principles and best practices tailored to the **Modular-MCP-for-OEM-Compatibles** framework. It covers every layer—from configuration files and dynamic modules to the C++ core, CLI, and deployment environment—to ensure a robust, resilient, and trustworthy system.

## 1. Security by Design
- **Embed security from day one:** Treat security as a core feature, not an afterthought. Incorporate threat modeling during architecture reviews and track risks continuously.
- **Defense in depth:** Apply multiple layers of controls (validation, sandboxing, access restrictions) so that compromising one layer does not lead to total system compromise.
- **Secure defaults:** Ship with conservative settings (e.g., disable dynamic module loading by default, restrict config file permissions to owner only).

## 2. Configuration Management & Input Validation
- **Schema validation:** Define a strict JSON/YAML schema for all configuration files and validate at startup. Reject unknown fields or out-of-range values with clear error messages.
- **File permissions:** Require configuration files and module directories to have `chmod 600` (owner read/write only) on Linux/Unix. Reject world-readable or writable configs.
- **Path sanitization:** When parsing file paths (e.g., module binaries), canonicalize and ensure they reside within an allow-listed “modules/” directory to prevent path traversal or loading from untrusted locations.
- **CLI argument checks:** Enforce type, range, and format validation on all command-line parameters. Reject or escape any characters that could be interpreted by the shell or operating system.

## 3. Secure Dynamic Module Loading
- **Allow-listing & signing:** Maintain an allow-list of approved module filenames or checksums. Consider code-signing modules and verifying signatures (e.g., using public-key cryptography) before loading.
- **Version compatibility:** Embed version metadata in each module and verify compatibility at load time to avoid running untested or malicious code.
- **Least privilege for modules:** If the OS supports it, run each module in a restricted sandbox (e.g., Linux Namespaces, chroot, AppArmor) with only the permissions needed to open specific hardware device files (e.g., `/dev/i2c-*`).
- **Isolation:** Load modules into a separate address space or process where feasible. Communicate via IPC or a controlled event bus to reduce memory corruption risks.

## 4. Access Control & Privilege Management
- **Least privilege runtime:** Run the MCP service or CLI under a dedicated, non-root user account. Grant only the minimal device file permissions required (e.g., group membership for I2C/SPI).
- **API and CLI security:** If a future network API is added, enforce strong authentication (e.g., TLS client certificates, API keys) and role-based access control so that only authorized users can issue sensitive commands.
- **Session management (if added):** Should a persistent service or web dashboard be introduced, implement secure session IDs, timeouts, and CSRF protections.

## 5. Memory Safety & Secure Coding Practices in C++
- **Modern C++ standards:** Use C++17 or later to leverage safer language features (e.g., `std::string_view`, smart pointers, `std::optional`).
- **RAII patterns:** Manage all resources (memory, file handles, device handles) through RAII to prevent leaks and use-after-free errors.
- **Static analysis & fuzzing:** Integrate tools like Clang-Tidy, AddressSanitizer, and libFuzzer into CI to detect buffer overflows, null dereferences, and undefined behavior.
- **Avoid unsafe APIs:** Do not use raw `new[]/delete[]`, `sprintf`, or unchecked `memcpy`/`strcpy`. Prefer `std::vector`, `snprintf`, and safe container APIs.

## 6. Logging & Error Handling
- **No sensitive data in logs:** Never log hardware credentials, private keys, or personally identifiable information (PII). Sanitize error messages to avoid leaking internal paths or stack traces.
- **Structured logging:** Use a library like `spdlog` to include timestamp, module name, log level, and a unique correlation ID for multi-module operations.
- **Fail securely:** On critical failures (e.g., config validation failure, module signature mismatch), exit with a nonzero code and preserve a minimal, sanitized log for forensics.

## 7. Data Protection & Privacy
- **Encrypt at rest (optional):** If configuration files include secrets (e.g., signed module keys, device passwords), store them in an encrypted keystore or integrate with a secrets manager (e.g., HashiCorp Vault).
- **Secure transport (future):** Should the MCP expose a network API, enforce TLS 1.2+ with strong ciphers, certificate validation, and HSTS for any web endpoints.

## 8. Dependency Management
- **Vet third-party libraries:** Only include reputable, actively maintained dependencies. Regularly review their CVE status.
- **Lockfiles & reproducible builds:** Commit `CMakeLists.txt` and any `vcpkg` or `Conan` lockfiles. Pin Python/Node.js libraries in `requirements.txt` or `package-lock.json`.
- **Automated scanning:** Integrate SCA tools (e.g., OWASP Dependency-Check) into CI to flag known vulnerabilities in direct and transitive dependencies.

## 9. Infrastructure & Deployment Security
- **Hardened build environment:** Use CI runners with minimal privileges. Disable shell access for automated build boxes.
- **Release artifacts:** Sign release binaries and packages. Provide SHA-256 checksums published alongside releases.
- **Environment isolation:** On production or test rigs, isolate MCP from other services. Limit open network ports to none (local CLI only) or to only those explicitly required.
- **Regular updates:** Schedule periodic reviews to update the OS, compilers, libraries, and build tools.

## 10. Testing & Verification
- **Unit & integration tests:** Achieve ≥ 80% code coverage. Use hardware mocks to simulate device failures and validate error paths.
- **Security testing:** Add targeted unit tests for config-parser edge cases, invalid module signatures, and path traversal attempts. Incorporate fuzz testing on CLI arg parsing and file readers.
- **Continuous monitoring:** Monitor CI pipelines for new vulnerabilities and enforce quality gates for static analysis, linting, and test failures.
