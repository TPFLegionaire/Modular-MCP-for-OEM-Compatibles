# Project Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Project Overview

The **Modular-MCP-for-OEM-Compatibles** project is a flexible, plug-and-play framework designed to manage and control a wide variety of Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) hardware components—such as sensors, actuators, and power management units—without rewriting core logic for each device. It achieves this by providing a **Modular Control Panel (MCP)** architecture: each hardware type is wrapped in a self-contained module that implements a common interface. This way, developers simply add or configure modules rather than modify the central codebase, dramatically reducing integration effort when supporting new hardware.

The main purpose of building this framework is to simplify the development, testing, and deployment of control solutions across different OEM hardware ecosystems. Success will be measured by how easily a developer can onboard a new OEM device (adding a module and updating a config file), the reliability and performance of the control panel in real-world scenarios, and the clarity of documentation that guides users from zero to a running system within minutes.

## 2. In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope

**In-Scope (Version 1.0)**
- Core system/manager with lifecycle management for modules.  
- Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) modules for I2C, SPI, UART (serial) communication.  
- Functionality modules for basic use cases (e.g., fan control, temperature monitoring, power sequencing).  
- Configuration-driven operation using JSON or YAML files.  
- Dynamic module loading and simple dependency injection at runtime.  
- Internal event bus for inter-module messaging.  
- Command-Line Interface (CLI) for interacting with the MCP (start/stop, status, manual commands).  
- Basic logging and error-reporting infrastructure.  
- Unit and integration test setup (mocked hardware interfaces).  

**Out-of-Scope (Phase 2 or later)**
- Graphical User Interface (GUI) or web dashboard.  
- RESTful or network-based API endpoints.  
- Hot-plug device detection and auto-configuration.  
- Module versioning or compatibility management beyond semantic version tags.  
- Advanced security features (authentication, encryption for network communication).  
- Mobile app or remote-control support.  

## 3. User Flow

First, a hardware developer or integrator writes a **configuration file** (JSON or YAML) that lists the OEM devices in their system and maps each to the corresponding module name and parameters (e.g., I2C bus ID, register addresses, operational thresholds). They then install the MCP runtime on their target platform (Linux, Windows, or embedded OS) and place any custom HAL modules in the `modules/hal` folder.

Next, they launch the MCP via the CLI with a command like `mcpctl --config config/system.yaml`. The core manager reads the configuration, dynamically loads each module, injects required dependencies, and initializes communication channels. Once running, the user can issue commands such as `mcpctl fan set-speed 75` or `mcpctl temp read` to interact with hardware. The CLI also provides `status` and `logs` subcommands to view real-time events and system health.

## 4. Core Features

- **Modular Control Panel Manager**  
  - Orchestrates module lifecycle: load, initialize, start, stop.  
  - Provides dependency injection for modules.  
- **Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) Modules**  
  - I2C, SPI, UART drivers with a common interface.  
  - Encapsulate register reads/writes and error handling.  
- **Functionality Modules**  
  - FanController: set/get fan speeds; monitor status.  
  - ThermalManager: subscribe to temperature events; trigger cooling actions.  
  - PowerSequencer: safely sequence power rails on/off.  
- **Configuration Parser**  
  - Reads JSON/YAML; validates schema; defines module graphs.  
- **Event Bus**  
  - Pub/Sub mechanism for modules to broadcast and consume events (e.g., `TemperatureExceeded`, `ModuleError`).  
- **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**  
  - `start`, `stop`, `status`, `command` subcommands.  
  - Interactive or scripted mode.  
- **Logging & Error Reporting**  
  - Structured logs (timestamp, module name, severity).  
  - Graceful fault handling and exit codes.  
- **Testing Framework**  
  - Unit tests for each module with hardware mocks.  
  - Integration tests for end-to-end flows.  

## 5. Tech Stack & Tools

- **Core Language**: C++ (for performance, low-level hardware access)  
- **Scripting/CLI**: Python or Node.js (for rapid CLI development; can be swapped)  
- **Build System**: CMake (C/C++), setuptools or npm (CLI)  
- **Configuration**: JSON or YAML parsers (e.g., nlohmann/json for C++, PyYAML for Python)  
- **Dependency Injection**: Lightweight custom DI container in C++ or use existing library (e.g., Boost.DI)  
- **Event Bus**: In-process pub/sub library or custom implementation  
- **Testing**: Google Test (C++), pytest or Jest (CLI); test doubles for hardware mocks  
- **IDE/Plugins**: Visual Studio Code with CMake Tools, Clang-Tidy, and language-server extensions  

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**:  
  - Module initialization < 2 seconds total on typical embedded hardware.  
  - Command-response latency < 100 ms for simple HAL operations.  
- **Reliability**:  
  - 99.9% uptime during continuous operation; resilience to module errors.  
- **Security**:  
  - Local access only (CLI); sanitize all inputs to prevent injection.  
- **Usability**:  
  - Clear CLI help messages (`--help`); consistent naming conventions.  
  - Detailed error codes and guidance in logs.  
- **Maintainability**:  
  - 80% unit test coverage; consistent code style.  
- **Portability**:  
  - Support Linux, Windows, and major embedded platforms (ARM).  

## 7. Constraints & Assumptions

- **Hardware Availability**: Developers have access to target OEM hardware or suitable simulators/mocks.  
- **Platform Support**: The core runtime assumes a POSIX-like OS or Windows; real-time OS support is out-of-scope for v1.  
- **Dependency Availability**: CMake, Python 3.8+ (or Node.js 14+), and build tools are installed on dev machines.  
- **Configuration Files**: Users will author valid JSON/YAML; schema definition is provided.  

## 8. Known Issues & Potential Pitfalls

- **Driver Conflicts**: Concurrent access to the same bus (I2C/SPI) by multiple modules may cause contention.  
  - *Mitigation*: Enforce single-threaded access per bus or implement bus-level mutexes.  
- **Dynamic Loading Failures**: Missing or incompatible module binaries can crash startup.  
  - *Mitigation*: Perform schema and version checks before loading; fall back to safe mode.  
- **Event Storms**: Rapid bursts of hardware events could overload the event bus.  
  - *Mitigation*: Throttle event publishing; allow modules to subscribe with rate limits.  
- **Configuration Errors**: Invalid or missing parameters in config files may lead to runtime exceptions.  
  - *Mitigation*: Integrate strict schema validation and fail fast with descriptive errors.  
- **Resource Leaks**: Poor memory or handle management in C++ modules.  
  - *Mitigation*: Enforce RAII patterns and static analysis tools (e.g., Clang-Tidy).
